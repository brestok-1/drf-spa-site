I made this django project to explore new technologies and libraries, as well as hone my docker containerization skill.
In this project, I have collected the most popular and necessary tools for creating complex and full-fledged projects.

## Description

This is one of the most complex Django projects that I have implemented to date. I created an online store where you can
log in through social networks or register, receive email confirmation letters, purchase various products, sort them by
categories, and then pay through the Stripe system. You can also see a list of all your orders and their status. This is
a fully functional and ready-to-use online store.

Since I position myself as a backend developer, I focused on the internal components, not the appearance of the
site.

The main technologies used in the project are data caching with Redis, asynchronous email confirmation sending (I also
implemented the sending mechanism myself), social media authentication through django-allauth. The most time-consuming
task was connecting to Stripe. In addition to writing a controller that handles payments, I also had to configure
webhook operation. I also integrated Stripe products and the django admin panel so that when a new product is added, the
data is also updated in Stripe. It was not easy to package all of this into a Docker container, ensure the seamless
operation of each service, and automate the deployment of the web application in Docker.

## Project setup

***Method 1: Via docker-compose***

1. Create a .env file and paste the data from the .env.example file into it.
2. Generate django secret key on [this site](https://djecrety.ir/) and specify it in the SECRET_KEY variable.
3. Specify the user, password and name for the PostgreSQL and insert the values in the variables POSTGRES_USER,
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB.
4. Create an email and configure it to send messages. You can learn more about how to do
   this [here](https://youtu.be/dnhEnF7_RyM?t=902).
5. Run the project by entering following command:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

6. Perform migration to the database:

```
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

7. Create a superuser by entering the following command:

```
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

8. You can log in to the [admin panel](http://0.0.0.0:8000/admin) and add new articles and comments or upload the
   fixtures I created by entering the command:

```
docker-compose exec web python manage.py loaddata core/fixtures/blog.json
```

***Method 2: Via virtual environment***

1. Create and activate a python virtual environment
2. In the terminal, enter the following command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a .env file and paste the data from the .env.example file into it
4. The value of the variables POSTGRES_HOST and REDIS_HOST specify 'localhost'
5. Specify the user, password and name for the PostgreSQL and insert the values in the variables POSTGRES_USER,
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB.
5. Generate django secret key on [this site](https://djecrety.ir/) and specify it in the SECRET_KEY variable.
6. Create an email and configure it to send messages. You can learn more about how to do
   this [here](https://youtu.be/dnhEnF7_RyM?t=902).
8. Perform migration to the database:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

9. Create a superuser by entering the following command:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

10. In the terminal, enter the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

11. You can log in to the [admin panel](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) and add new articles and comments or upload the
   fixtures I created by entering the command:

```
python manage.py loaddata core/fixtures/blog.json
```

#### Remember that you must have PostgreSQL and Redis installed on your computer.
